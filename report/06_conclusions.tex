\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

BGP table has more than doubled in 6 years

The BGP table growth outstrips IP allocation rate

Every industrialized nation is participating in BGP table growth

ISPs prefer to fragment large allocated blocks into smaller chunks, e.g., /24 prefixes account for more than 50\% of routing table

Demand for IP addresses outpaces the rate IPs are returned to RIRs

Multihoming and traffic engineering techniques introduce redundancy in BGP table (58\% in 2009)

BGP table is highly dynamic (only 16\% is static)
