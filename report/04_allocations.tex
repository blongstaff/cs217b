There is another dynamic occurring while the BGP table size grows steadily, and that concerns table entries appearing and disappearing, obviously with appearances outnumbering disappearances that account for the table growth.  Thus, fourth, we will chart both allocation/deallocations and table prefix appearances/disappearances on a monthly basis.
